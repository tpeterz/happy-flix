entertaining poorly planned single feature film due enormous amount detail handled ok shoot tell watching film cinema audience start get bit restless well mine overlong frankly rather dreary film opening somewhat dystopian scenes reminded blade runner hit ground running amidst hotly contested mayoral election chap gas mask riddler learn later brutally takes sitting candidate enticing batman robert pattinson come help policeman pal gordon jeffrey wright investigate seems killer wanted happen leaves caped crusader card clue soon great good city dropping like flies web corruption deceit top echelons government emerging personally found bit dull flows terribly slowly relentless darkness really pretty soporific moody effort pattinson started bore loads plot holes least riddler manages pull pretty heavy duty crimes without scale tall buildings sneak past heavily guarded victims spree scenes completely unprotected da peter sarsgaard dimly lit street plain daft colin farrell probably highlight duplicitous oz zoÃ« kravitz cat offers us decent acrobatics otherwise hugely overrated affair serious paucity dialogue heavily scored almost three hours enough actually happens indeed reluctant let us leave admit first guess ending bit optimistic could conclude least another four times finally allowed stretch legs might look better second time around nothing write home good albeit great newest incarnation batman well done also incredibly dark like robert pattinsons portrayal didnt employ annoying voice kind ruined dark knight dark knight rises whole though like plot parts inspired long halloween good supporting cast paul dano giving creepy performance riddler looking forward seeing zoe kravitzs selinacatwoman tired superhero movies still mild case corona wanted something watch thatd go easy batman available picked say one rare superhero movies appeal thats seen every batman movie since tim burtons one dare say even fed superhero movies think best attempt three hours feels like bingewatching threepart miniseries mean extent three acts almost perfectly align hour also pacing great never got bored cast excellent also first time ever im thinking ridiculous one recognizes bruce wayne batman halfmask actually makes bruce wayne unrecognizable im sure thought casting really quite impressive also nice suffer pathetic attempt batman make voice sound cool oh dear christian bale trying look sound cool cringey robert pattinson far best batman ive ever seen almost depressive mental torment conveys come fake pretension thats first batman franchise far im concerned mood bleak without depressive score fantastic bit much cinematography amazing really little fault anything may come little pretentious selfindulgent thats also part attraction im completely honest think people need grow stop watching childish things prejudice fact inside fing loves need embrace childish part rather hate theres anything would change movie feel somewhat pgification batman would love see movie bleak desperation lust vengeance depravity evil gotham world seriously antihero allviolent bringerofdeath batman would love see crude outfit less bells whistles definitely without cape destroy slay kill exploration terrible aftermath would bring including impact psyche rather beatupandletgo strategy using movie part feels align doomish mood sets story seeming existential depression masked protagonist think would warrant yet another installment franchise im actually surprised much meat character also movie overall consistently bit much ending takes one notch scale regardless two superhero movies keep movie collection watchmen directors cut star deducted catwoman racist without presented problem casting perfect way much better michelle pfeiffer oh boy yet another review tmdb movie comic books garners much interest longer comic hero fan either movies source comic books seen marvel series one would watch multiple times came across screen ant man wasp wit action humor read superhero comics kid however stuck dc comics especially liked legion superheroes though also read justice league superman batman silver age comics believe restarted complicated field reimagining comic universe whatever anyway dc boy gave batman look see dark film themes camera work wit humor speak grim introspective comic book noir intriguing interesting enough hold attention couple interesting twists traditional batman villains example lot current thrillers quite body count sometimes violence think less film watch multiple times anxiously await sequel regret time spent watching batman best liveaction batman movie yet type batman film ive waiting whole life dark realistic also stylish largescale limited commitment realism like dark knight trilogy burdened shared universe like dceu thing moody disturbing visually stunning david fincherinspired three hour long detective epic best interpretations characters ever put screen robert pattinson fantastic younger moodier yes emo batman paul dano straight terrifying riddler colin farrell unrecognisable ways one penguin zoÃ« kravitz easily favorite liveaction catwoman massively underrated john turturro carmine falcone movie kept hooked way almost three hours long feels like two best batman movie dark knight good reeves finds perfect mix gritty realism style nolan would never even dare snorricam shot batmam gliding city finally gives us liveaction batman lives title worlds greatest detective theres much competition since hes like one actually detective work christian bale magically finding fingerprint broken bullet doesnt count movie one best batman movies opinion honestly didnt like thus portrayal batman didnt feel like batman like batdude like man real life grew watching batman decided fight crime name overall definitely worth watch batman returns back detective roots breath fresh air robert patterson stunning batman twists turns new riddler take fun ride verdict masterpiece honest really good movie hang give stars well really personal good batman movie really problems writing review good movie like batman movie movie really dark gritty noir really problem works movies also quite slow beginning first quarter movie actually boring remember three hour movie quarter half hour broken pretty cool car chase people seem really like batmobile say inspired bad either unfortunately movie turned rather boring movie tries bring detective part batman previous movies fine much moping around batman bruce wayne walking around oozing sadness around actually brings us main gripe movie choice actor batman wrong like sad puppy batman script makes mope around emotional outbreaks occasionally downright stupid like staring dumbfounded explosives go face really help course selina kyle character charisma batman especially batman bruce wayne alter ego really really dislike twist parents lazy hollywood writer hack thing create unwanted drama riddler compared charismatic villains come expect sad little psychopath bunch equally sad fanatical internet followers would worked great movie unspecified vigilante movie really well done detective story action especially towards end noir setting would worked great even three hour bloated length would great although cut two hours bit would even better batman movie batman terribly bad movie would twice good half long film likes take shortcuts especially still take almost three hours get going foggiest rather strange enterprise gives us andy serkis flesh covers colin farrell prosthetic makeup fat suit directorcowriter matt reeves wisely avoids origin stories takes granted relationships already well established decadeslong canon certain characters hand allows movie become bogged halfway point deluge backstory obvious problem enough material least two films reeves attempts cram single one know going sequels save next chapter better yet leave cutting room floor absolutely reason penguin movie might well imperceptible man actual batman villain mind given catwoman pretty much played far riddler believe going say jim carrey much better job role paul dano otherwise fine actor inexplicably chose play character bastard child heath joker tom bane leaves carmine falcone john turturro provides intriguing plot points make main even dare say villain batman long enough try patient saint least great look like first tim burton batman described unerring roger ebert triumph design story style substance greatlooking movie plot care much gotham city particular winning combination faux noir texture christopher plausible architecture best scenes involve batman robert pattinson jim gordon jeffrey wright indeed pattinson uncanny knack playing veteran character actors sort prerobin dynamic duo adventures poignant appear happen real world least real world wherein grown man disguises giant bat compare last zack snyders justice league unending cgi assault senses worst batman ever seen firstly robert pattinson worst choice batman role twilight alright batman definitely failed like sad depressed goth kid emotions tried much fit role fact got depressive dead empty batman secondly small things sucked movie example cat woman simple stupid mask even older movie versions better mask batmans batmobile also sucked looked like downgraded version also rode simple bike lastly couldnt even glide default batman suit also dont know james gordon played black actor every movie even every game character white riddler character also seemed stupid wearing stupid mask acting stupid wasnt intimidating laughable general cast acting disappointing movie lastly movie dull boring depressive tried make masterpiece hours long reality movie became plain boring almost fell asleep overall
