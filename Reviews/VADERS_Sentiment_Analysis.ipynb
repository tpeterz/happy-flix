              "0  FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/dune-part-two-review-the-new-generational-epitome-of-sci-fi-epics/\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dune: Part Two surpasses even the highest expectations, establishing itself as an unquestionable technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a narrative that deepens the complex web of political relationships, power, faith, love, and destiny, it not only provides a breathtaking audiovisual spectacle, thanks to the genius of Denis Villeneuve, Greig Fraser, and Hans Zimmer, but it also offers a profound meditation on universal human themes through thematically rich world-building and thoroughly developed characters. The superb performances of the entire cast, led by a career-best Timothée Chalamet and a mesmerizing Zendaya, further elevate this incredibly immersive cinematic experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt warrants comparisons with the greatest sequels in history, easily becoming the new generational epitome of sci-fi epics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: A+ As anticipated, a thrilling watch!\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed <em>'Dune'</em>, though remember thinking it was obviously a complete set-up to a sequel and that this would only improve upon its predecessor - and that's very much the case. <em>'Dune: Part Two'</em> is excellent! My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. \\r\\n\\r\\nBring on <em>'Dune Messiah'</em>! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so! This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!! An absolutely mesmerizing masterpiece, breathtaking cinematography and a spellbinding soundtrack that elevate the viewing experience to unparalleled heights. It serves as a testament to the brilliance of the book series, standing as the pinnacle of sci-fi cinema history. Thanks, Villeneuve! Great but a little long. Sexier than LotR and no hair. Yell acting. Jabba bathes in black goo and kills women horribly. Walken is hilarious. Zendaya still an addict. Bridges is a bit self-serious. Amazing visuals. Really enjoyed...was glad and a bit bored by the end. Shorter Dunes please. Saw it on the bigger screen, which was worth it. The worms were quite large. The movie has a great way of passing across the grand scale of the world in a way that michael bay can never understand how to do with his robots movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did stretch on quite a bit, looking back not even sure where all the three hours went. Its just all shaping up for the big battle with a bit of political intrigue here and there. Also, still have no idea how they get off the worms or how they load up large groups of people onto the worms, like, can they stop the worms whenever they want and let people climb on, and then giddy up, but if thats the case why dont they have stabled worms ready to go. I had to watch Dune part 1 because if I didn't, I would not have known what to expect in Dune part 2. The movie was incredible. To see it on the big screen really makes a difference. You need to see every angle possible. I understand why it needed to be that way. I loved the movie. I would watch Dune 1 and 2 over again. I didn't like the scene where Feyd-Rautha died. But it was necessry if they planned on doing a third installment for Dune. The casting for this film was picked brilliantly. It fit them like they were part of the era of Dune itself. **Not bad**\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a nice movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not something extraordinary. The acting and direction were pretty average. There were a lot of editing mistakes. In some scenes, you feel like it was rushed. Some scenes feel like they are missing context. Some scenes are unnecessarily slow-paced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a lot of stupid and logical fallacies. First, they show how dangerous those 'worms' are and run for life. Then they show you can actually 'tame' them like a cowboy, but with immense difficulty. Then you see the whole clan with tents, food, luggage, etc., riding them for traveling. I literally couldn't hold my laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, in the end, I was entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: 7/10 I remember the first film, no not the first in this contemporary series but the first attempt to bring the books, to cinema. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of contextual cohesiveness and pacing I feel it did a better job, than its latter day counterpart. I believe with this effort they are going for sweeping epic but somehow it comes across as inexplicably pedestrian.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes cinematography is remarkable, as are CGI effects but the pacing is slow and things happen that don't come together all that well or give the sense that they are contributing, meaningfully, to the overall story. Acting is competent but again, its not remarkable, which I think is in part down to a lack of depth, in characterisations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know this review probably wont be popular or reflective of the mainstream but I sense they are trying to do too much and as a consequence, achieving too little.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, visually compelling but lacking in a certain intensity and depth. Feels contextually spare and at times redundant, if that makes sense. Still worth a look if you liked the books.   \n",

However, as a fourth film in a franchise, it’s a ton of fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though it’s action isn’t quite as entertaining as its predecessors and it’s unfortunate to see Awkwafina playing yet another thief (_Jumanji: The Next Level_ says hello), for the most part, _Kung Fu Panda 4_ happily skadooshes its way to animated greatness.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/KuFuPa4 This is probably my favourite of the franchised animated action-comedies, but I think we are now clearly running out of conceptual steam. With \"Po\" being told by \"Master Shifu\" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the \"Chameleon\" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. \"Po\" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend \"Zhen\" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the \"Furious Five\". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it. **Written by kindergartners using AI**\\r\\n\\r\\nEven after more than 10 years, I still miss the first Kung Fu Panda movie as it was genuinely a masterpiece. The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. \\r\\n\\r\\nPathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to \"Mary Sue\" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won’t be watching any more trash from this franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.\\r\\n\\r\\n*I wanted to give it 1.5, but the sliding scale couldn’t select it, so I gave it 2/10.   \n",

More Hollow Earth, more Titans, more gloriously giant fights filled with fantastic visual effects… and much more nonsense too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough an openly absurd narrative, Adam Wingard takes the charm and chemistry of his cast to help focus the film’s main spotlight on the titanic protagonists, Godzilla and Kong, delivering two hours of pure, unadulterated entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt won’t convert the most skeptical, but it will certainly solidify the unashamed passion of MonsterVerse fans.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with \"Kong\" ruling the roost deep in \"Hollow Earth\"; \"Godzilla\" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and \"Ilene\" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled \"Jia\" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for \"Monarch\" and mankind. \"Kong\" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, \"Trapper\" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. \"Godzilla\" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by \"Kong\" and his human pals. With \"Bernie\" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why \"Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times \"Kong\" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from \"Jurassic Park\" to episodes of \"Stargate\". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth. A whole load of nothing!\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>'Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire'</em> is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCatching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like <em>'Kong: Skull Island'</em> at least...   \n",

FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/road-house-review-a-generic-yet-superior-remake/\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Road House keeps the screenplay superficial and formulaic, but the narrative changes and more captivating new characters make the remake a more satisfying watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast led by a Jake Gyllenhaal in excellent form – in every sense of the word – possesses enviable chemistry, with the surprising highlight falling on Conor McGregor’s debut, infusing the movie with intense, truly crazy energy. The action sequences suffer slightly from some excess stylization but serve their basic purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more significant focus on character development, especially in the central romance, would have been welcome, but it remains a pleasant home viewing experience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B-   \n",

Guess what? Yep - she finds it, and almost immediately too! Anyway, it turns out that her pal isn't so friendly after all and pretty sharpish she is shot and face up in a pool of healing waters where her baby is being delivered by a jungle people with spidey-skills. Advance twenty-odd years and we meet paramedic \"Cassie\" (Dakota Johnson) who drives around with her partner \"Ben\" (Adam Scott), indifferently saving folks from disaster. It's one such disaster, though, that sees her tumbled deep into the river and having to be rescued by her buddy. This trauma appears to trigger something weird. She is getting flash-fronts. She can see the tiniest snippets of the future - and that doesn't usually bode well for anyone, including her! A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be \"Deadpool\" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal \"Mattie\" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of \"Highlander\" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those \"Superman\" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting! Ouch, that average rating! I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching <em>'Madame Web'</em>... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I always say, to each their own. For me, gimme a sequel (as long as the cast remain, mind). Not even sorry. Wooooow. Worse than the Marvels. Why did they dance on the table for like 20 guys? Who chose those glasses? But I sure do want a crisp, refreshing Pepsi Cola. Deadly good taste. Perhaps it was the perceived and preconceived notion that I had of this film being really bad as shown by its ratings scores from various sites, but I found this film actually really funny in a campy sort of way and better than decent in terms of not-big-budget superhero-film sort of way. In short, I came away enjoying it and unhappy with how this movie was portrayed in the movie-review media. I think it was just a piling on of the mob-mentality reviewers who tried to kick somebody who was already down, but anyway, I do hope this gets a sequel and I do hope the filmmakers continue with the campy, unintentionally funny, very quiet scenes with no theme music whatsoever style, low-budget-but-still-decent CGI, and over-all enjoyable moviemaking which can be watched and enjoyed for an hour and a half. A huge departure from those 3-hour self-important cinematic \"spectacles\" of today.   \n",

The superb performances of the entire cast, led by a career-best Timothée Chalamet and a mesmerizing Zendaya, further elevate this incredibly immersive cinematic experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt warrants comparisons with the greatest sequels in history, easily becoming the new generational epitome of sci-fi epics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: A+ As anticipated, a thrilling watch!\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed &lt;em&gt;'Dune'&lt;/em&gt;, though remember thinking it was obviously a complete set-up to a sequel and that this would only improve upon its predecessor - and that's very much the case. &lt;em&gt;'Dune: Part Two'&lt;/em&gt; is excellent! My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking &lt;em&gt;(those sandworms tho)&lt;/em&gt; and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista &amp; Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. \\r\\n\\r\\nBring on &lt;em&gt;'Dune Messiah'&lt;/em&gt;! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so! This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!! An absolutely mesmerizing masterpiece, breathtaking cinematography and a spellbinding soundtrack that elevate the viewing experience to unparalleled heights. It serves as a testament to the brilliance of the book series, standing as the pinnacle of sci-fi cinema history. Thanks, Villeneuve! Great but a little long. Sexier than LotR and no hair. Yell acting. Jabba bathes in black goo and kills women horribly. Walken is hilarious. Zendaya still an addict. Bridges is a bit self-serious. Amazing visuals. Really enjoyed...was glad and a bit bored by the end. Shorter Dunes please. Saw it on the bigger screen, which was worth it. The worms were quite large. The movie has a great way of passing across the grand scale of the world in a way that michael bay can never understand how to do with his robots movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did stretch on quite a bit, looking back not even sure where all the three hours went. Its just all shaping up for the big battle with a bit of political intrigue here and there. Also, still have no idea how they get off the worms or how they load up large groups of people onto the worms, like, can they stop the worms whenever they want and let people climb on, and then giddy up, but if thats the case why dont they have stabled worms ready to go. I had to watch Dune part 1 because if I didn't, I would not have known what to expect in Dune part 2. The movie was incredible. To see it on the big screen really makes a difference. You need to see every angle possible. I understand why it needed to be that way. I loved the movie. I would watch Dune 1 and 2 over again. I didn't like the scene where Feyd-Rautha died. But it was necessry if they planned on doing a third installment for Dune. The casting for this film was picked brilliantly. It fit them like they were part of the era of Dune itself. **Not bad**\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, a nice movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not something extraordinary. The acting and direction were pretty average. There were a lot of editing mistakes. In some scenes, you feel like it was rushed. Some scenes feel like they are missing context. Some scenes are unnecessarily slow-paced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a lot of stupid and logical fallacies. First, they show how dangerous those 'worms' are and run for life. Then they show you can actually 'tame' them like a cowboy, but with immense difficulty. Then you see the whole clan with tents, food, luggage, etc., riding them for traveling. I literally couldn't hold my laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, in the end, I was entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: 7/10 I remember the first film, no not the first in this contemporary series but the first attempt to bring the books, to cinema. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of contextual cohesiveness and pacing I feel it did a better job, than its latter day counterpart. I believe with this effort they are going for sweeping epic but somehow it comes across as inexplicably pedestrian.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes cinematography is remarkable, as are CGI effects but the pacing is slow and things happen that don't come together all that well or give the sense that they are contributing, meaningfully, to the overall story. Acting is competent but again, its not remarkable, which I think is in part down to a lack of depth, in characterisations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know this review probably wont be popular or reflective of the mainstream but I sense they are trying to do too much and as a consequence, achieving too little.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, visually compelling but lacking in a certain intensity and depth. Feels contextually spare and at times redundant, if that makes sense. Still worth a look if you liked the books.</td>\n",

However, as a fourth film in a franchise, it’s a ton of fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though it’s action isn’t quite as entertaining as its predecessors and it’s unfortunate to see Awkwafina playing yet another thief (_Jumanji: The Next Level_ says hello), for the most part, _Kung Fu Panda 4_ happily skadooshes its way to animated greatness.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/KuFuPa4 This is probably my favourite of the franchised animated action-comedies, but I think we are now clearly running out of conceptual steam. With \"Po\" being told by \"Master Shifu\" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the \"Chameleon\" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. \"Po\" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend \"Zhen\" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the \"Furious Five\". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it. **Written by kindergartners using AI**\\r\\n\\r\\nEven after more than 10 years, I still miss the first Kung Fu Panda movie as it was genuinely a masterpiece. The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. \\r\\n\\r\\nPathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to \"Mary Sue\" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won’t be watching any more trash from this franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.\\r\\n\\r\\n*I wanted to give it 1.5, but the sliding scale couldn’t select it, so I gave it 2/10.</td>\n",

More Hollow Earth, more Titans, more gloriously giant fights filled with fantastic visual effects… and much more nonsense too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough an openly absurd narrative, Adam Wingard takes the charm and chemistry of his cast to help focus the film’s main spotlight on the titanic protagonists, Godzilla and Kong, delivering two hours of pure, unadulterated entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt won’t convert the most skeptical, but it will certainly solidify the unashamed passion of MonsterVerse fans.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with \"Kong\" ruling the roost deep in \"Hollow Earth\"; \"Godzilla\" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and \"Ilene\" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled \"Jia\" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for \"Monarch\" and mankind. \"Kong\" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, \"Trapper\" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. \"Godzilla\" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by \"Kong\" and his human pals. With \"Bernie\" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why \"Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times \"Kong\" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from \"Jurassic Park\" to episodes of \"Stargate\". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth. A whole load of nothing!\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;em&gt;'Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire'&lt;/em&gt; is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole film feels like if &lt;em&gt;'&lt;a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;'&lt;a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/a&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCatching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like &lt;em&gt;'Kong: Skull Island'&lt;/em&gt; at least...</td>\n",

Yep - she finds it, and almost immediately too! Anyway, it turns out that her pal isn't so friendly after all and pretty sharpish she is shot and face up in a pool of healing waters where her baby is being delivered by a jungle people with spidey-skills. Advance twenty-odd years and we meet paramedic \"Cassie\" (Dakota Johnson) who drives around with her partner \"Ben\" (Adam Scott), indifferently saving folks from disaster. It's one such disaster, though, that sees her tumbled deep into the river and having to be rescued by her buddy. This trauma appears to trigger something weird. She is getting flash-fronts. She can see the tiniest snippets of the future - and that doesn't usually bode well for anyone, including her! A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be \"Deadpool\" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal \"Mattie\" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of \"Highlander\" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those \"Superman\" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting! Ouch, that average rating! I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching &lt;em&gt;'Madame Web'&lt;/em&gt;... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I always say, to each their own. For me, gimme a sequel (as long as the cast remain, mind). Not even sorry. Wooooow. Worse than the Marvels. Why did they dance on the table for like 20 guys? Who chose those glasses? But I sure do want a crisp, refreshing Pepsi Cola. Deadly good taste. Perhaps it was the perceived and preconceived notion that I had of this film being really bad as shown by its ratings scores from various sites, but I found this film actually really funny in a campy sort of way and better than decent in terms of not-big-budget superhero-film sort of way. In short, I came away enjoying it and unhappy with how this movie was portrayed in the movie-review media. I think it was just a piling on of the mob-mentality reviewers who tried to kick somebody who was already down, but anyway, I do hope this gets a sequel and I do hope the filmmakers continue with the campy, unintentionally funny, very quiet scenes with no theme music whatsoever style, low-budget-but-still-decent CGI, and over-all enjoyable moviemaking which can be watched and enjoyed for an hour and a half. A huge departure from those 3-hour self-important cinematic \"spectacles\" of today.</td>\n",

being through the perspective of a little talking shell that walks on the walls of a normal sized house by stepping in a puddle of honey The film is laugh out loud funny, sad in a gut punching kind of way, and overwhelmingly bighearted _Marcel the Shell with Shoes On_ is a heartwarming delight\\r\\n\\r\\nFull review  Huge heart in this film Its funny, philosophical, life affirming and just a pure pleasure to watch The fact that its stop motion animation makes it a complete wonder How MORE SPOILERFREE REVIEWS  \\r\\n\\r\\nMarcel the Shell with Shoes On transported me back to the precious times I shared with my late grandfather\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extraordinarily creative, moving story surrounded by incredibly genuine humor and filled with meaningful, memorable messages about family, friendship,

the contents of that drawer were unceremoniously emptied into a bag leaving Marcel in his current, rather lonely, predicament Every evening he and his granny watch Sixty Minutes and it occurs to them that presenter Lesley Stahl might just be able to help the family reunite What follows now is a thoroughly enjoyable, characterful and engaging little drama that sees Marcel  quite a shrewd and quickwitted fella  and Dean set about turning his circumstances into a matter of international significance Question is  well, will it pay off Of course there is no jeopardy, its just a fun story  tinged with a touch of tragedy, that elicits feelings of longing, family, loneliness sure, but also of family, optimism and all set in an environment that is ideal for wandering around the walls after youve stuck your tiny feet in honey I really did enjoy this By Louisa Moore  wwwScreenZealotscom\\r\\n\\r\\nWith strong themes of friendship, family, and always doing whats right, theres so much to love about the poignant and sweet animated mockumentary, Marcel the Shell With Shoes On Everything about this film is simply delightful, from its simple stopmotion animation to terrific voice performances from Jenny Slate and Isabella Rossellini\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the hit YouTube film series from the 2010s, the film tells the story of the tiny shell Marcel voice of Slate and the daytoday life that he leads with his grandmother, Nana Connie voice of Rossellini The pair live in a house in the suburbs that, after the couple who used to reside there had a very nasty breakup, is now being rented out as an Airbnb When human documentary filmmaker Dean Dean FleischerCamp rents the place, he befriends Marcel, learning that his entire shell family disappeared two years ago Armed with a camera, Dean decides to help his new pal find his lost clan, shooting a documentary about their epic quest\\r\\n\\r\\nIts a simple story told in an elemental style, but director FleischerCamp has created a world of pure joy Marcel is as cute as they come, a sweet, positive little guy with the sunniest of dispositions He travels around in a tennis ball, climbs the walls by smearing honey on his feet, uses toenail clippings for skis, and has a pet ball of lint Its the little things that are so inventive and clever, so be sure to pay attention to the small details Its a lot like the scenes where Marcel gets carsick when he rides on Deans dashboard theres something irresistible about seeing the world through a shells eyes, and it becomes an effortless endeavor to find an appreciation for everything in your own surroundings, too\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this sounds like a movie thats great for kids, its probably better for older tweens and up Its a film thats more pensive than colorful or actionpacked, and there are moments that talk openly and frankly about grief, fear, and death With the help of Nana Connie, Marcel gains the courage to take risks that are scary but important, and he gains a ton of confidence along the way The story also has a timely life lesson about the world of social media, and Marcel is given a heavy dose of reality when he learns that many of his online fans want to exploit him rather than actually help him find his family\\r\\n\\r\\nJust ten minutes into the movie, I was concerned that the eccentricity would wear thin quickly, but it does not FleischerCamp, Slate and Nick Paleys screenplay is so wise and tender and emotionally touching that even when the story ended, I wanted more I cannot say enough positive things about this entire project because there are no missteps here Thats why Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is one of my favorite films of the year\n",
            "1468    Fantastic story given a quite smashing adaptation  \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery once in a while, when Hollywood is stuck for new swashbuckling ideas, they turn to the writer of The Three Musketeers, The Man In The Iron Mask and The Count Of Monte Cristo, one Alexandre Dumas père Which of course is no bad thing as long as the adaptation is given care and consideration  which hasnt always been the case So when it was announced that the director of Waterworld, Kevin Reynolds, was to direct the latest version of The Count Of Monte Cristo, many feared the worst Made for around 35 million, Reynolds film fared OK at the Worldwide box office, taking in around 76 million Yet although far from being a flop, it upped and vanished rather quickly and was barely given a mention come the arrival of 2003 Thankfully the film gathered momentum with the rental releases and is now firmly established as a much loved genre piece\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the two big hitting movie internet sites, Rotten Tomatoes  IMDb, the film scores 75 and 75 respectively, thats about right I would say Reynolds film doesnt bring anything new to the table as regards the story, but if it isnt broke then why fix it Staying safe and true to the spirit of the source, Reynolds has simply crafted a rip roaring movie about betrayal, torture, faith, revenge and love The makers have costumed it up and added the necessary sword play ingredient All that was needed was for his cast to deliver performances worthy of such period shenanigans And he got them\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes Two years away from playing Jesus Christ, the role that would make his name known, Caviezel had prior to Cristo looked anything but a leading man But here he finds a role to get his teeth into and its a comfortable fit, and crucially he seems to be having a good time with it No such point to prove for Guy Pearce Fernand Mondego though, for he already had LA Confidential  Memento under his belt Here he gives it the full pompous villain act and struts around like some dandy spoiled brat Its a film stealing performance that shows that the guy who played Mike Young in Aussie soaper Neighbours, has indeed come a long way Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Abbé Faria, gravel voiced Michael Wincott does a nice line in sadistic bastard as the Château DIf governor, Armand Dorleac While Luis Guzmán as Jacopo is fun comic relief and Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedès Iguanada is both sensual and heartfelt\\r\\n\\r\\nNever over camping the movie, Reynolds keeps it pacey and dots it with smart set pieces and memorable scenes Backed up by an on form cast and a sure fire source story to work from, The Count Of Monte Cristo turns out to be period winner So see it if you havent done so already 810 Jim Caviezel is adequate, no better, as the wronged Edmond who gets caught up in a Napoleonic conspiracy that sees him confined on a remote island prison from which noone escapes alive His situation seems hopeless, until he receives an unlikely visitor  the elderly Abbe Faria Richard Harris, who has been trying to tunnel his way out but took a bit of a wrong turning The two become firm friends, and his parting gifts to the younger man are the secrets of an immense treasure  and his bodybag  that might enable him to seek revenge on Fernand Guy Pearce Villefort James Frain and Maurice Christophe Adams whose machinations stole a great chunk of his life, and cost him the love of Mercedes Dagmara Dominczyk His vengeance is cleverly structured, he determines to allow each of these people to turn on each other  using their own greed and mistrust to destroy the other Alexandre Dumas wrote a great story, with loads of intrigue  yet somehow this iteration doesnt really get going Too much of the build up is abridged or just not there at all and that makes the rest of the story weaker and less engaging The production is adequate, the costumes and look of the film are good, but the pace and performances are both about box office than about characterisations I felt indifferent about all of them  even the naive young Albert Henry Cavill whose character is actually quite pivotal in the book, helping remind Edmond of the humanity he once had before incarceration There are way better versions of this story  notably the Robert Donat one from 1934, and Id recommend that instead, any day Well, its not one quality but I like to do a thumbs up or thumbs down approach If the movie entertains a thumbs up, if it doesnt a thumbs down Seems simpler than debating on a 4, a 5, a 6, whatever\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also kind of why I want to be able to review individual actors, just so I can write a memo to Guy Peirce and tell him that he needs to stop doing period literary pieces and go back to making films that dont require ascots and puffs\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this brings me to the point in the review where I question why I know what the difference between an ascot and a puff are\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, selfreflection aside, the problem is that it doesnt know if it wants to be a thrilling adventure novel that is best epitomized by the writings of Dumas in all his pulp adventure glory or if the story lasted in popularity for a century or so too long and now has to be regarded as a drama and treated with all the seriousness of a mature literary classic\\r\\n\\r\\nIt teases with both and never settles on either It kind of comes across that Wolpert, the writer, understood that Dumas was a pulp adventure writer but Reynolds, the director, thought Dumas was as serious as Dante\\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes you feel like you are sitting in two different worlds It kind of feels like you are watching a movie that wants to be a fun adventure yarn about revenge and prison breaks but every time that beast tries to escaped, its forced back into its cage by directorial gods of pretentious pompery\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the type of movie that youd get if the director of Taming of the Shrew thought everything Shakespeare wrote was Richard III its unsettling how deadly serious it takes itself\n",

recommend\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introductory scene and general premise is ridiculously depressing, especially since it is a real world problem  While it does setup the movie fairly well, they did not get good enough cg for the lion  And thats without comparing it to Disneys uncanny valley of realistic animal animation\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thrilled to see Megan Fox show her range in this though  As someone who was not a fan of her early career, Im increasingly impressed with her\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a great example of a good paramilitary movie  It really makes me wish they had left out the lion bit altogether  Overwhelming odds against a noble objective for money makes for a great movie concept\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actual execution has some great production value minus the lion, and the cast does a fantastic job  The writing is compelling both from a character standpoint and immersive strategy survival standpoint\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you like firearms action, rescuing princesses from castles, or just Megan Fox, then give this a shot\n",

felt I couldnt consider myself a selfrespecting cinephile unless I at the very least sampled more works both by female directors and from the gaylesbianrelated subgenre Fortunately my university offered in its library collection an assortment I decided to peruse occasionally Although Deitchs film is a romantic drama featuring lesbians, I still readily enjoyed it Glad I took a chance on it and decided to expand my horizons as a adventurous film aficionado As a lesbian myself, I have to say I was extremely grateful when a friend recommended I watch this film some 12 odd years ago when I was a willowy 1415 year old realising that my private emotions were geared towards my own sex but I didnt want to tell the world just yet\\r\\n\\r\\nI must admit to struggling to stay with this slow burner, probably due to my impatient teenage angst But stay with it I did and I have to say it was well worth the journey\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it had a relatively graphic but erotic lesbian love scene, but the film is more than that, not least for the great character study of the two protagonists, and a rather uplifting conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen many lesbianlove story films since then, not least Below her Mouth and Blue is the Warmest Color  both of them exceptionally well done But for me, Desert Hearts still stands out as an emotive and well handled love story that will stay with me until my dying days\n",

Creatures from the Black Lagoon \\r\\n\\r\\nThis Roger Corman production was released in 1980 and concerns a northern California fishing community beset by humanoid marine creatures intent on killing the dudes and having sex with the ladies Its as if the creatures say Where all dem white wimmens at Doug McClure plays the lead protagonist, Jim Hill, while Anthony Pena is on hand as a persecuted Indian, Johnny Eagle\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monsters arent too far removed from the Gillman from Creature from the Black Lagoon 1954, albeit with big heads, sharp teeth, loong arms and huge tails The setting and tone is similar to the contemporaneous Prophecy 1979 and The Fog 1980, except that Humanoids from the Deep throws in the rape angle and female nudity, mostly top nudity, but one woman on the beach is shown fully nude\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of the women, curvy Cindy Weintraub stands out as Jim Hills wife, as does voluptuous Lynn Theel, both uniquely attractive dont expect boring thin blondes with fake breasts There are a couple of other notable cuties Meanwhile towering Ann Turkel plays the requisite marine scientist\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shocking tackedon epilogue is well done, but it rips off Alien 1979 Been there, done that and done better\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie runs 1 hour, 20 minutes and was shot in the Fort Bragg area of Northern California It was remade in 1996 with Emma Samms and Robert Carradine\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE B\n",

deserves to be right up there with the best of the Mad Max films, and I suspect an indifferent ad campaign doomed it from the start I love it when a film delivers a lot more than I expected, which is what you get here  Rutger Hauer and Joan Chen are the primary players on a team of roving athletes who play a brutal game involving two sides, each of which is attempting to win by being the first to spike the skull of a dog on the opposing teams post dont ask  the origin of this sport is never revealed  The winning team gets room and board, and maybe a cut of the betting  Think of it as a variation of baseballs farm system and minor leagues  Sully, Rutgers character, reached the major leagues before the film begins, but due to poor judgement in choosing his bed partners, was cast all the way down to the bottom, and hes trying to make it back  The teams that get to the top are allowed to commingle with this future societys one percenters who hold all the wealth and power  They also get a vicarious thrill watching their sports heroes bleed playing the game, hence the title\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is well paced but sparse, you get to learn just enough to understand whats happening and why  Because of the context in which it is portrayed, it seems to never get dated Almost no romantic moments, but violence  Oh, yeah If for no other reason, the films ending scene where Sully instructs Kidda Joan Chens character what her next actions should be, elevates this above most other films in the genre  Let me put it this way  I gladly rewatch this one every chance I get  My vote  4 and 12 stars\n",

                                              A definitive downgrade on the first film, but this sequel still entertains to a good level\\r\\n\\r\\nemThe Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspianem is a suitably entertaining production, if not an exceptional one though its not far off I like the fresh new story and the fact that all four of the youngsters remain, but the change from dark, snowy settings to plain, summerlike conditions means the film does lose some spark Theres also much less intrigue with the villains\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgie Henley Lucy, William Moseley Peter, Anna Popplewell Susan and Skandar Keynes Edmund are again enjoyable in their roles Liam Neeson, just barely, reprises his role of Aslan  his inclusion does feel forced, as great a character as he is\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from those four, you have a number of new faces Ben Barnes Caspian, Peter Dinklage Trumpkin, Warwick Davis Nikabrik and Eddie Izzard Reepicheep are my standouts Barnes is solid, I liked watching Caspian Dinklage is great, while Davis and Izzard are welcomed newbies Like the first film, the casting here is done astutely\\r\\n\\r\\nThey definitely shouldve shortened this though, the ending does drag a fair bit Theres also a couple of different moments that feel like the end, yet evidently arent  theres certainly more than a few pacing issues\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that said, I still had a more than decent time watching\n",

pageant\\r\\n\\r\\nIm one of those guys who does not believe chick films are for girls alone, actions are for men, as well as magic films for kids I watch them all, well, at least I admit that So, not in my childhood, but overall Ive seen many DCOM and Ive liked many of them This film came half a decade ago, I was aware of it, but only now I had watched it and it got me by surprise\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought it would me another mean girl tale, thats where I was wrong Well, in the initial few minutes, thats how it looked, but everything has changed since the beginning of the second act That was the biggest plus point of this film Even though predictable scenes, still it felt good enough The character transformation, the way it was done was very smart At one stage you hate, then a soft corner develops\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a television film, but thats not how it looked The quality of the story was like a theatrical film If they had risked on that, they definitely would have succeeded I would say a bad decision by the production house, but still the product delivered more than its expectation The casting was good, All of them were new face to me, except Sasha Pieterse\\r\\n\\r\\nExpecting a sequel for a goodsuccessful film is so common with its fans I thought about the same, but seems they are not interesting in one which was kind of confirmed in the end itself Even though if they decide to make, it wont be as good as this one Because the main story, all happened in here Just like Taken which is very powerful original film, not suitable for followups This is a silly concept,

Replacements takes the Mediocre and gives them their chance in the spotlight\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie starts out with the professional football players going on strike, midseason, to demand even more money to play a kids game The league owners decide to finish out the season with whatever players they can acquire mirroring the 1987 NFL strike The Washington Sentinels owner goes a completely different direction by rehiring one of his old coaches and giving him complete control of the team Coach McGinty then goes about putting together his Dream Team of WannaBes and NeverWeres who, if the stars aligned just right, might just reach their full potential\\r\\n\\r\\nAn EXCELLENT popcorn movie that would have received 5 stars if there had been more football in the football movie Nevertheless, it is packed full of great oneliners Hes Wiry and will have you tossing off nonsequiturs the next day all day long Thatll do pig Thatll do Overall  Hilarious characters and a heartwarming story perfect the formula of Major League delivering one of the best and funniest sports movies ever made\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all the charm of Major League and a cast of zany lovable characters, The Replacements stands out as my favorite sports movie of all time Led by Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman, this team of hilarious scrappy nobodies and hasbeens get their shot as pros, but this goofy comedy disguises a heartwarming story as these crazy characters find redemption and family in each other A classic in every way, The Replacements shines through its entertaining cast, excellent writing, and satisfying story anchored by one of Keanus many iconic roles\n",

   I never watched these films from what I remember at least in the 90s, I did used to watch CLASS ACT with Kid N Play over and over though so not sure why\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the title made it sound lame, not much for parties so a whole movie about just that didnt seem that intriguing maybe\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyhows I did decide to watch it today and I must say I wasnt really impressed, it simply wasnt very funny Not even Martin Lawrence who I usually find hilar is funny\\r\\n\\r\\n Some scenes were okay the battle rap scene stood out the most, the only scene I thoroughly enjoyed but overall nah A pretty tame comedy, and too much focus came to thinking about how Kids eraser head hair do looked for me\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch HANGIN WITH THE HOMEBOYS with Doug E Doug and John Leguizamo instead, or FRIDAY with Cube or yeah why not CLASS ACT\n",

and his buddy Joel David Moore and Deon Richmond decide to take a night sightsee with other tourists at the alligatorinfested bog, unaware of the dubious nature of the tour and the legend of a notorious hatchet man lurking the woods\\r\\n\\r\\nHatchet 2006 is a horrorcomedyspoof that combines the indoor swamp sets of ManThing 2005 with elements of the Wrong Turn or Friday the 13th franchises and the parody tone of Club Dread 2004 Regrettably, its the least of these Theres nothing wrong with the cast or technical filmmaking as the gore, FX and swamp sets are fine, although the monster makeup looks kinda cartoonish which fits the genre\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile its relatively amusing and occasionally funny, its hindered by an odious raunchy air right out of the gate For instance, the two supposedly hot girls flash their breasts every 5 minutes in the first half hour Dont take that as prudish, Im just pointing out that a movie is questionable when it goes overboard with female nudity to hide its deficiencies Meanwhile the heroine played by Amara Zaragoza is interesting, but she has little sex appeal, although thats a matter of taste\\r\\n\\r\\nI could handle those flaws if the story was more compelling and the humor more amusing, yet thats not the case Although the plot is great, the script needed a rewrite to flesh out better prospects But that takes time  money and the flick only cost 15 million, which is almost six times LESS than what Club Dread cost\\r\\n\\r\\nI should add that Kane Hodder plays the Jasonlike antagonist while Robert Englund has a cameo in the opening     \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, with a longer version running an additional 9 minutes It was shot in New Orleans Mardi Gras sequences with the swamp scenes done in a convincing indoor set at Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE CD\n",
            "544     Where does it end  It never ends\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Homers mythical epic The Iliad is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersens 2004 epic Troy In other words, dont expect any goofy gods or goddesses like Athena popping out of thin air because Troy is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than that, Troy is arguably the best sword  sandal epic ever put to film You name the picture  Samson and Delilah, Spartacus, BenHur, Ulysses, The Viking Queen, Conan the Barbarian, Braveheart, Attila, The Odyssey, Gladiator, etc  Troy is superior At the very least its as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like BenHur, and far edges out Spartacus and Samson and Delilah As for more recent sword  sandal epics, like the overrated Braveheart or Gladiator, Troy blows em out of the water \\r\\n\\r\\nRoger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of Troy is all wrong Eberts major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek gods  goddesses and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not largerthanlife caricatures This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film Ulysses, but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in Troy His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homers myth is based Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding Brad Pitts heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldnt care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greeces greatest warrior No, hes not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but hes fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate Even his voice completely fits the role Eric Bana from Hulk is also great as Hector, Achilles Trojan counterpart, whos sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest manoamano sword  sandal duel ever filmed\\r\\n\\r\\nWhats interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other When Achilles and Hector have their powerful faceoff, my wife and I couldnt decide for whom to root Maybe thats the point Dont get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasnt rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus wife, but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the good guys or bad guys Theyre just people at war, and in war theres no real glory, as Hector points out and it never ends, as Achilles states An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence And both Bana and Pitt get this across well\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable Diane Kruger plays Helen, the face that launched a thousand ships Some have complained that shes too plain for the role, but I disagree Im not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me not to mention has an impressive behind shot Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh\\r\\n\\r\\nI should point out that Troy was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen Make no mistake, Troy is breathtaking just to WATCH  the colossal armies, ships and battles are aweinspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fakelooking like the Rome  Coliseum scenes in Gladiator \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy nothing could be further from the truth There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles comment that the gods envy people because were mortal and Everythings beautiful because were doomed Thankfully, theres not one goofy oneliner anywhere to be found\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Horners score should also be mentioned If you enjoyed the soundtrack of The Passion of the Christ youll love this one because its just as goodseriousreverentpowerful For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hectors showdown is magnificent\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting Fitting, no \\r\\n\\r\\nFINAL WORD If youre in the mood for a sword  sandal epic, Troy more than fills the bill The story captivates from the getto and never lets up the entire 25 hour runtime technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mindblowing, outstanding piece of cinema\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE A Its yours, take it \\r\\n\\r\\nTrojan prince Paris is not only having an affair with Spartan Menelaus woman, Helen He also lures her away to live with him in Troy Thus giving the global domination obsessed King Agamenon the launch pad to war with Troy Which in turn brings into conflict Spartan hero Achilles and Hector of Troy, two of the greatest warriors that ever lived\\r\\n\\r\\nTroy, budgeted at 175 million, and given to director Wolfgang Petersen with orders to craft a swordplay epic based on Homers Illiad, is not the truly great picture it really should have been It is, however, a spectacle of sorts, that by way of the extended directors cut, becomes a fine enough addition to the genre it so clearly wanted to crown\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problems are evident from the off The casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles always looked to have been based purely on looks Nicely toned body and brooding close ups do not a warrior make, and thus, as good an actor as Pitt definitely is, this is a role and genre too far Diane Kruger as Helen is under written, which since at the time was a poor actress yet to bloom turns out to be a bonus here, and Orlando Bloom playing the wimp like Lothario Paris the way he should do  still gets out acted and swamped by all around him The other main problem is how uneven the story telling is Petersen looks confused as how to condense the Trojan war in the running time, whilst also juggling the emphasis of the two great warriors at its core That Eric Banas excellent portrayal of Hector comes through the jumble is a testament to Banas ability and nothing else\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good is, well, rather good though Agamemnon, courtesy of a nasty turn from Brian Cox, is well formed It gives the picture a reason for being outside of it being a war about some bloke stealing a woman from another bloke Imperial cravings and a genuine thirst for blood helps lift Troy out of the rocky waters it had found itself in Peter OToole, Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do fine work with what little they have got, and the production values on offer are hugely impressive The fight sequences impact and are full of gusto The fight off between Hector and Achilles is superbly choreographed fought out to a score that James Horner has lifted from the one Danny Elfman used for Planet Of The Apes three years earlier and the battle between the armies outside the walls of troy sits with the best in the genre CGI is often called the bane of cinema, but when used so well as it is here see the ships approaching Troy for instance it proves to be an effective and entertaining tool\\r\\n\\r\\nTroy has problems, of that there is no doubt But come the end one knows that it has been entertained, one knows that this was a time of heroes So with that, and the knowledge that the film made a profit of just over 320 million worldwide, Petersen can smugly sit in his chair musing it was job done 710 A long watch, but just about a worthwhile one\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed emTroyem, in short A film, interestingly given his recent exploits, written by a certain David Benioff It definitely has more than a few pacing issues, but they only affect the enjoyment factor minorly  at least to me The score is a little lacklustre, mind\\r\\n\\r\\nThe casting is outstanding, even if I dont think all the performances are anything to truly shout about I found Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, although entertaining, a bit wooden in parts\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean are arguably underused from an acting viewpoint  though their characters play huge parts, of course You also have a load of other familiar faces, from Peter OToole to Brendan Gleeson to Rose Byrne to Diane Kruger The definition of an ensemble\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action helps keep things moving, the battle sequences are very nicely done The film takes an age to reach the event that everyone knows about, but when it finally does its excellent\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast and the action are my big takeaways from this I couldnt comment on its accuracy on the original work As a film, for me, its very good It took a while, but Brad Pitt finally did some great films\\r\\nThis and Fury stick out on Pitts resume as his masterpieces thus far\\r\\nHere, we have the most credible and least Hollywood look at the Iliad and the Trojan War \\r\\nThe characters are very likely as they were, if they really existed, with motivations explained quite well, save for one motivation\\r\\nIt is hard to see Achilles as someone who tells a kid that living dangerously will make you famous a thousand years into the future Even if Achilles is that introspective, its hard to see that point of view being something someone would believe in, especially in an ancient world where few names are remembered after death, and certainly not for thousands of years\\r\\nAside from that, we get very credible explanations for all the recorded events, without the brown nosing of Homer, although the brown nosing of Odysseus still exists even in this story\\r\\nThis is quite easily, and I say undeniably, the most exciting, the most credible, and the best depiction of the Trojan War and the Iliad ever out of a major studio Now then, where do we start On the plus side, this is one of the more intelligent applications of CGI in an historical drama setting The film delivers lots of epic grandeur the at seascenesbattles are classily produced and the attention to detail across the costume and prop departments is outstanding Sadly, though, the acting isnt at all joined up At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them Peter OToole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise its a loose collection of Alister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction As an endtoend adventure film, it isnt as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation  Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon Brad Pitt Achilles, and particularly Eric Bana Hector are shockingly wooden Orlando Bloom Paris  Garrett Hedlund Patroclus appear there merely as eyecandy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke This is undoubtedly a story that could have made Cecil B De Mille proud, instead I suspect hes have nodded off\n",

                                                                                                                  The depiction concerning doomsday dramas in the movies always seem to have a mixed bag reception when tackling its dour subject matter about the possible annihilation of the planet Earth The scales of dramatic overdrive can be rather preachy and psychologically exhausting or convey overthetop unintentional hilarity Thus, only a few endoftheworld genre films can pull off the genuine angst and realistic vibes about mankind facing its final fate of fury as our jeopardized existences are in considerable question\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the blistering and noteworthy 2003 Australian apocalyptic lowbudget film These Final Hours, writerdirector Zak Hilditch delivers a somber and sleek story about mass paranoia and the redemptive vibes of one man caught up in the hysteria of the catastrophic bleakness that persists  Thoroughly absorbing and telling, These Final Hours resourcefully captures the psychological urgency and the humanistic hedonism that exists under such worldwide adversity Thoroughly absorbing and thoughtprovoking, the stark These Final Hours offers a telling hypnotic depth that more contemporary flashier and fueled fare may fail to carry out in their frenzied translation\\r\\n\\r\\nHilditchs tense narrative is not necessarily the definitive showcase on saucy doomsday dramas to ever emerge Still, it has a simplistic and gritty edginess to its message of global despair and destruction that certainly helps its cause as a perceptive and contemplative human horror show In its own lowkey appeal of desperation and doom, These Final Hours is undoubtedly powerful and dares to ask introspective questions of its audience pertaining to survival and how ones final hours would be emotionally shaped as in the limited time of planetary panic\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the pending question at large remains what is the impact of a vulnerable society upon the wake of Earths final run as a planetary playground for an exposed mankind Well, for one troubled man in James Nathan Phillips he is our conflicted tour guide to all the mayhem that persists in the last 12 hours that Earth has to remain whole before an asteroid arrives to obliterate its last pit stop Australia The inevitability of endangered lives in James region of Perth is a harsh reality so the reactions of the surrounding territory is understandably erratic and laced with fear and in some cases nervousminded frivolity\\r\\n\\r\\nJames is not what would call a goody twoshoes He thinks nothing of hopping from one woman to another He has rowdy and raunchy companions Basically, James is a bluecollar stud without much going on in a stagnant livelihood Still, he does has some semblance of consciousness as he boldly confronts a group of weaponcarrying thugs that are adding more unruliness to an already hostile environment or panicking and paranoia In the process, James becomes the unlikely rescuer for an aimless little girl named Rose Angourie Rice He takes the frightened child under his wing as soon the tandem roam the area in the middle of sheer chaos as the critical countdown to eradication continues\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, James and Rose are each others comforting cohorts as they travel among the ruins of damaged property, flameinduced vehicles and, of course, the fellow citizens that range from partyhearty rabblerousers to Godfearing believers praying for salvation as the murky mirror for gloom creates a bigger shadow of sorrow and scorn\\r\\n\\r\\nSadly, James and Rose must shift through the turmoil that is indeed a human tragedy spearheaded by the expected suspense of natural bombastic deterioration The sense of helplessness and hopelessness is weighing in on the millions of people so distraught and disillusioned that they are powerless to prevent the ultimate demise of a planet destined for extinction The forged fatherdaughter dynamic between James and Rose in the face of a dire worldly washout is surprisingly poignant, intense and gently tender\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Final Hours works its soulful and menacing magic because it does not solely concentrate on the grand scale of the horrorinduced incidents shaky buildings, grimy graffiti, burned out cars, a collection of trash can fires, etc so much as it brings the startling focus to the human psyche, the real centre for the horrific happenings of anxiety and outrage Hilditch is astute enough to fixate on the inherent ugliness at hand, the inner conflict of human anticipation and aggravation in the event of the massive worlds ending The film is not afraid to tap into the visual debauchery of the human element as it is prominently punctuated around the impressionable tyke Rose The fact that this kids eyes has to endure the degradation of sex, drugs and brutality gives Hilditchs twitchy narrative its corrosive credibility\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authenticity behind the mental makeup of These Final Hours is productively challenging in that the turbulence of troubled waters is not just witnessing the breakdown of dressy disasteroriented special effects or even succumbing to Bonnie Elliotts exquisite cinematography Instead, Hilditch dares to provide a unique kind of wrecking ball meltdown in the human victims wicked, wayward or wonderful and place them as the centerpiece of beleaguered behavior where the true dramatics percolates with refreshing gusto\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, These Final Hours were well spent minutes on the clock in watching this wellstructured doomsday drama unfold with intriguing forethought\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Final Hours 2015\\r\\n\\r\\nRoadshow Films\\r\\n\\r\\n1 hr 27 mins\\r\\n\\r\\nStarring Ethan Phillips, Angourie Rice, Jessica De Gouw, Daniel

                       Disparate bunch of toughguy types plucked from various dumb action subgenres a blackops mercenary, a Spetsnaz operative, a drug cartel goon, a yakuza, a killer, a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, all of whom get an opportunity to do their thang at some point during the movie, get picked off one by one in typical fashion, in a setting designed to evoke the 1987 originals jungle shenanigans Meh Cant say that I entirely buy into Adrian Brody as an action hero lead, either Arguably the worst leading toughguy since Danny Glover in, um, Predator 2\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething else bugged me about it, too Its a petty quibble, but it irked me nonetheless\\r\\n\\r\\nSPOILERS AHEAD\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you ever see the trailer for Predators At the 123 mark is IMO the most effective shot in the trailer Brodys character has one of those iconic triangulated laser sights from the predators shouldermounted guns pointed at him It moves up his body to his head As it does, many more sights appear, all over him More than a dozen He has about fifteen predators all training their guns on him Hows he going to get out of that Hes fooked Well, no, hes not, because that scene DOESNT HAPPEN in the film The first laser sight happens, yes, from the ONE predator of three  that are chasing them, but fifteen No All those other sights are added in just for the trailer, to make the film look more Predatorfilled than it is\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said, a rather petty quibble, but its one thing to edit the best bits of a movie together into a trailer to make it look more exiting than it maybe is over the course of two hours, and quite another to lie about what one can expect to see in said movie They can hear you Smell you They see you \\r\\n\\r\\nPredators is directed by Nimród Antal and stars Adrien Brody, Topher Grace, Alice Braga, Laurence Fishburne, Oleg Taktarov  Danny Trejo Its coproduced out of 20th Century Fox by Robert Rodriguez, John Davis  Elizabeth Avellan, with writing credits going to Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and Jim  John Thomas Its shot on location in the Hawaiian jungle with Gyula Pados on cinematography, while John Debney reworks Alan Silvestris score from the 1987 film Predator \\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot sees eight former members of Earth  mercenaries, soldiers, criminals and a doctor, who are literally dropped into a jungle on an alien planet Why or how they got there is not known, but pretty soon it is apparent they must work together for they are being hunted by an unseen enemy Hunted, it seems, for sport \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987 John McTierrnan gave the movie world Predator, a ballsy Vietnam allegory that pitted Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other considerably sized beefcakes against one bad ass mandible wearing alien hunter Since then the franchise has steadily got worse though the Danny Glover led sequel is far from a disaster, reaching a crushingly bad nadir with Aliens vs Predator Requiem in 2007 Enter Robert Rodriguez who in the mid 90s had done a treatment for a Predator sequel  with Schwarzenegger in mind to return However, it didnt happen and its only now, with the franchise at rock bottom, that his script has been reworked and funded to give us Predators, the sequel to McTiernans 87 ball buster \\r\\n\\r\\nThe set up is a little different but in truth the formula is exactly the same as the original movie Macho guys and a girl in the jungle are being hunted by something very bad Alpha male, though, is not going to take it lying down, cue deaths, explosions and much macho posturing Here in is the main problem with Antal s movie, its ticking the same boxes whilst homaging for all its worth, which is fine since its hugely entertaining in that Saturday night popcorn way But theres little to no braveness in the writing Sure theres some bonuses in the form of alien pets, a predator feud arc and a bonkers midsection with the introduction of another character Yet as the carnage unfolds, the plot doesnt go anywhere other than where we expect it to go, while theres a huge character misstep in the final third that is more laughable than being the twister its obviously meant to be \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if taken purely as a piece of salted popcorn, the film delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant the viewing because the action comes thick and fast From the breathtaking opening as we are literally dropped into the jungle with Adrien Brody, to the inevitable face off for the finale, we have been treated to stabs, chops, thrusts, dismemberments, beheadings and everyones personal fave  spine ripping All this and theres barely any blood spilt, lest the green kind counts of course While the new look predators are awesome, more meaner in tone, with new armour and devoid of the pointless characterisation that others in the franchise have tried to give them, these are unremitting killers, lets leave them like that please And while it lacks the dark humour of McTiernans movie, it does have a wry sense of knowing, normally with the portrayal of Royce by Brody \\r\\n\\r\\nBrody is just fine, its a performance that shows that should he ever want to make the easy money available in actionadventure type movies Then he will have no problem getting work Hes buffed up, given himself a gruffer voice and more than shows a capable hand at punching, firing and sticking the tongue firmly in cheek The others, unsurprisingly, are walking clichés, with some obviously only there to be deathly slotted more quickly than the others The fun here is in waiting to see who gets it firstnext and etc It has to be said, though, that Topher Grace is not only annoying, hes also very miscast, but in fairness hes not exactly helped by the writing of his character either \\r\\n\\r\\nNot great but hugely enjoyable popcorn fodder A sequel would be welcome, but with Rodriguez directing and a new face on the writing panel 710\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                 According to Wikipedia, Centurion received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office when it was released, but I wonder how many people picked up on its fascist undertones \\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie is set in Britain during the Roman invasion in 43 AD Now, unless its propaganda or revisionism, the long and short if it is, or should be, that in an invasion the invaders are the bad guys and the invaded the good guys  forget geopolitics Im talking about simple storytelling here \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Centurion expects us to identify with the invading forces, a rapport that it slyly, yet deliberately, encourages by having the Romans speak the Queens English, while the native Picts  the others, as it were  speak Gaelic, a Scottish language that even Scots hardly know In modern terms, what this movie wants from us is tantamount to asking us to cheer for Nazis or, conversely, jeer at Ukrainians \\r\\n\\r\\nSure, the hero is but a soldier and, as we know from Tennysons Charge of the Light Brigade, a soldiers lot is not to reason why  but to do and die  but precisely therein lies the problem Quintus Dias Michael Fassbender, and by extension writerdirector Neil Marshall, never question warmongering what does bother them, though, is war without honor We are, therefore, meant to take a moral stance based on whether one side fights dirty or not, without taking into account what each is fighting for Thus the Picts, who are defending their home and freedom, are scorned because they will not be drawn into open combat Instead, they pick at the scab until we bleed, hiding in the shadows like animals, striking hard and fast then falling back into the night Never mind that the Romans were the ones who drew first blood \\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the main antagonist is a character whose village was slaughtered as punishment for resisting Roman rule  they burnt out her fathers eyes  raped her mother until she was begging to die  before she too was raped  finally they cut out her tongue that she may not speak ill of the bloody Roman Empire \\r\\n\\r\\nThats your plucky, underdog hero right there  but when it comes down to Quintus and her, were somehow supposed to root for him Moreover, we are required to approve of Quintuss romantic interest, a woman called Arianne who helps the Romans out of spite because she has been ostracized by her fellow Britons I believe the denomination for such an individual is collaborator Quintus himself eventually turns his back on the Roman Empire  but only because they, for reasons not worth mentioning, try to kill him  in order to join Arianne as a pariah \\r\\n\\r\\nDid Marshall figure that, given enough time, one can look at history as if it were mythology  without the hindrance of having to make a distinction between right and wrong After all, you can safely choose between Greeks and Trojan in the Iliad and retain a clear conscience, but I shudder to think of a future where Saving Gefreiter Reichmann would be a viable idea for a blockbuster The eponymous Quintus Michael Fassbender is struggling through the snow to escape the menacing Picts who have just ambushed and destroyed his outpost He has to get the message to Gen Virilus Dominic West before the whole of Britain is overrun by these warlike people That man commands the ninth legion, and en masse they head north into the perilous wilderness  guided by Etain Olga Kurylenko  to seek vengeance Further into enemy territory they go before betrayal and disaster befalls them Only Quintus and a few of his colleagues manage to escape Can they make it to Hadrians Wall and safety The photography is good in this film, the Scottish scenery is shown off in all its glory, hostility and bleakness as the men strive to outrun their enemy and reach safety The rest of it, though, is all rather disappointing Neither the acting nor the writing is really up to very much, and with the possible exception of rather adept with a blade Tarak Riz Ahmed and his extremely fastacting dead cap mushrooms, the whole thing is just a bit clunky and slow with too much score The combat effects are generally quite good, though, and at times it has an authentic brutality to it, but neither Fassbender nor West are really in their element and I felt it seemed a great deal longer than 100 minutes I like the genre and I have seen much worse, but given this must have had a decent budget this could have been better with just a little less prattle, some better casting and a bit more action\n",
